/**
 * Runs an ordered {@link Action} pipeline over a {@link ScriptState}. Reusable across scripts: a
 * concrete script builds a runner with its own actions (bound to its own state type) and calls
 * {@link #run(ScriptState)} once per tick with a fresh state.
 *
 * <p>Actions are sorted by {@link Action#order()} once at construction. Each is asked
 * {@link Action#needsExecution}; if true, {@link Action#execute} runs and its return value is
 * recorded under the action's key. Both calls are isolated so one throwing action can't abort the
 * rest of the tick.
 *
 * @param <S> the state type shared by all actions in this runner
